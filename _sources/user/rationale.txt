Rationale
=========


Objectives
----------

* Develop a scriptable and easy-to-use framework for *Parallel in Time* (PinT)
  algorithms such as *SDC* and *PFASST* including their multi-level and
  multi-grid siblings.


Goals
-----

* provide simple interfaces to ...

  * ... setup a (mathematical) problem to compute / solve

  * ... configure different PinT algorithms to apply

  * ... plugin engine for customizable routines

* plugin engines could drive different routines for

  * logging

  * solution evaluation


Scope
-----

* *PyPinT* should aid in collecting experience and knowledge on implementation
  details to ease future development of highly parallel and efficient C++
  implementation
