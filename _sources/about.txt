*PyPinT* is a framework for Parallel-in-Time integration routines.

The main purpose of *PyPinT* is to provide a framework for educational use and prototyping new parallel-in-time
algorithms.
As well it will aid in developing a high-performance C++ implementation for massively parallel computers providing the
benefits of parallel-in-time routines to a zoo of time integrators in various applications.

*PyPinT* is developed by Torbjörn Klatt (@torbjoernk) and Dieter Moser (@DiMoser) during their doctorate at the
Jülich Supercomputing Centre.
